# RuleEmergence
This repository will contain simulation code for Cuskley, Kirby & Loreto (2018) "A Social Approach to Rule dynamics using an agent based model", to appear in a special issue of Topics in Cognitive Science on Sociolinguistics and Cognitive Science.

The code is currently being updated - while the current C++ version is functional, it sometimes crashes due to memory mishandling. A slower, but more robust, Python version of the code will be added soon.
