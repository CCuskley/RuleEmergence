# RuleEmergence
This repository will contain simulation code for Cuskley, Kirby & Loreto (2018) "A Social Approach to Rule dynamics using an agent based model", to appear in a special issue of Topics in Cognitive Science on Sociolinguistics and Cognitive Science.

The code is currently being updated, but detailed information on how to run the simulation will appear here soon.
